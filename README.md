# Facial Expression Detection-CNN

## Created By: Divya Dayashankar Jaiswal

### Facial Expression Detection with CNN using Keras and OpenCV

I have build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN) in Keras from scratch to recognize facial expressions. Test data used, consists of 48x48 pixel grayscale images of faces to classify each face based on the emotion. I have used here seven facial expression (Angry, Disgust, Fear, Happy, Sad, Surprise, Neutral). Used OpenCV to automatically detect faces in images and draw bounding boxes around them. After training, saving, and exporting the CNN, one can serve the training model predictions to a web interface and perform real-time facial expression recognition on video and image data.

#### Main Objective

* Develop a facial expression recognition model in Keras
* Build and train a convolutional neural network (CNN)
* Deploy the trained model to a web interface with Flask
* Apply the model to real-time video streams and image data
